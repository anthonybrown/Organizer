# Backbone Organizer

A simple app built with Backbone and Friends.
I'm using Handlebars.js for the templating because
it rocks, Jade or Handlebars are my favorite JS
templating engines but those are the one's I've had
the privelge to use.

Todo:
  1. Validate
  2. Add more features
	3. Create an Edit button.
	4. re-format code


###Backbone is what really got me interested in JavaScript.
It's my gateway language to the web lol.

So it's been way too long since I've used it
and was thinking about using it for a project I was
working on. It's an app that's already started and
it has "Spaghetti Code" all over the place.
